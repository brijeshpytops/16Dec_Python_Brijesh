File handling in C++ allows you to create, read, write, and manipulate files on the disk. The <fstream> library in C++ provides classes and methods for file handling. The primary classes used for file handling are:

ofstream: Used for writing data to a file (output file stream).
ifstream: Used for reading data from a file (input file stream).
fstream: Used for both reading and writing data to a file (file stream).

Common Steps in File Handling
Include <fstream> Header: Include the header file to use file handling classes.

Create Stream Objects: Create an object of ofstream, ifstream, or fstream depending on the operation.

Open a File: Use the .open() method or constructor to specify the file to work with.

Perform Operations: Perform read/write operations using stream objects.

Close the File: Use the .close() method to close the file and free resources.

# write data into the File
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream outFile("example.txt"); // Create and open the file
    if (outFile.is_open()) {
        outFile << "Hello, File Handling in C++!\n";
        outFile << "This is an example of writing to a file.\n";
        outFile.close(); // Close the file
        cout << "Data written to the file successfully." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open the file." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

# read data from the file

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream inFile("example.txt"); // Open the file for reading
    if (inFile.is_open()) {
        string line;
        while (getline(inFile, line)) { // Read line by line
            cout << line << endl;
        }
        inFile.close(); // Close the file
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open the file." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

# read and right data at onec from the file

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    fstream file("example.txt", ios::in | ios::out | ios::app); // Open in read/write/append mode
    if (file.is_open()) {
        // Append some data
        file << "Appending new data to the file.\n";

        // Move the file pointer to the beginning
        file.seekg(0, ios::beg);

        // Read the entire file
        string line;
        while (getline(file, line)) {
            cout << line << endl;
        }
        file.close();
    } else {
        cout << "Unable to open the file." << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
