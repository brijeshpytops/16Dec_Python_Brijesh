# What are operators and operands in python?

# A. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. They are used to perform mathematical calculations, comparisons, and logical operations.

# B. Operands are the values that operators operate on. They can be numbers, variables, expressions, or functions.

# Example:

# x = 10

# result = x + 5

# print(result)  # Output: 15


# A. Arithmetic operators
#     - Addition (+)
#     - Subtraction (-)
#     - Multiplication (*)
#     - Division (/)
#     - Floor division (//)
#     - Exponentiation (**)
#     - Modulus (%)

# B. Assignment operators
#     - Assignment (=)
#     - Addition assignment (+=)
#     - Subtraction assignment (-=)
#     - Multiplication assignment (*=)
#     - Division assignment (/=)
#     - Floor division assignment (//=)
#     - Exponentiation assignment (**=)
#     - Modulus assignment (%=)
#     - Bitwise left shift (<<=)
#     - Bitwise right shift (>>=)
#     - Bitwise AND (&=)
#     - Bitwise OR (|=)
#     - Bitwise XOR (^=)

# C. Comparison operators
#     - Equality (==)
#     - Inequality (!=)
#     - Greater than (>)
#     - Less than (<)
#     - Greater than or equal to (>=)
#     - Less than or equal to (<=)

# D. Logical operators
#     - AND (and)
#     - OR (or)
#     - NOT (not)

# E. Membership operators
#     - In (in)
#     - Not in (not in)

# F. Identity operators
#     - Is (is)
#     - Is not (is not)

# G. Bitwise operators
#     - Bitwise AND (&)
#     - Bitwise OR (|)
#     - Bitwise XOR (^)
#     - Bitwise NOT (~)
#     - Bitwise left shift (<<)
#     - Bitwise right shift (>>)
